SVG Logo Fix Instructions (for Sela’s Creations Logo)

(Save this as logo_fix_instructions.txt if you want.)

Purpose

These instructions describe how to properly convert the SVG logo so that all text is turned into vector paths. This prevents browsers from substituting incorrect fonts, ensures the logo displays consistently across devices, and avoids issues where the logo appears differently from the PNG version.

1. Open the SVG in Inkscape

The original SVG file must be opened in Inkscape, not a browser.

Steps:

Launch Inkscape

Open the file scbutterflyc13effff-10mm-angle-full-logo-2.svg

2. Select All Text in the Logo

The logo currently contains text objects (for example, “Sela’s Creations”), which browsers render using system fonts. This causes incorrect appearance.

Steps:

Press F1 or choose the Select Tool

Click each text object

If multiple text objects exist, drag-select the whole area or use Edit → Select All

3. Convert Text to Paths

This step transforms all text into vector outlines. Browsers will then render the shapes directly, without needing the original font installed.

Steps:

With all text selected, go to: Path → Object to Path

Repeat the conversion if elements are grouped.

4. Ungroup All Path Objects

Some SVG logos contain nested groups that must be separated before final export.

Steps:

With everything selected, go to: Object → Ungroup

If Ungroup is still available, repeat until it becomes disabled

All logo components should now be standalone path objects, not text objects

5. Save as a Plain SVG

Exporting as a “Plain SVG” removes Inkscape-specific metadata and ensures widest compatibility across web browsers.

Steps:

Go to File → Save As

Choose Plain SVG (*.svg)

Overwrite the existing SVG file or save a new version with a clean name

6. Verify That Text Is Fully Converted

To confirm the conversion worked:

Open the SVG in a text editor

Search for <text> tags

If text-to-path conversion succeeded, no <text> tags should remain.
The file should instead contain only <path> or <g> elements.

7. Replace the Existing Logo on the Website

Once the SVG is converted:

Upload or replace the file in:
assets/scbutterflyc13effff-10mm-angle-full-logo-2.svg

No other website changes are necessary. The browser will render the new path-only SVG exactly as intended.

8. Optional: Keep the PNG as a fallback

The existing PNG fallback can remain in the <img> tag as a safety measure, but is usually no longer required after the SVG is fixed.


Replace: 
      <!-- logo + tagline block in the center of the card -->
      <div class="content">
        <div class="logo">
          <img src="assets/scbutterflyc13effff-10mm-angle-full-logo-2.png"
               alt="Sela’s Creations logo">
               <!-- temporarily forces PNG only
                    (SVG removed until text is converted to paths) -->
        </div>

with:

      <!-- logo + tagline block in the center of the card -->
      <div class="content">
        <div class="logo">
          <img src="assets/scbutterflyc13effff-10mm-angle-full-logo-2.svg"
               alt="Sela’s Creations logo"
               onerror="this.onerror=null;
                        this.src='assets/scbutterflyc13effff-10mm-angle-full-logo-2.png';">
               <!-- fallback swaps SVG for PNG if the SVG fails to load -->
        </div>
